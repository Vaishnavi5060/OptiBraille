Our project, "OptiBraille: A Multimodal Assistive Technology for the Blind," aims to empower people with visual impairments by combining facial recognition, Braille text conversion, and real-time obstacle detection into a single portable device.  A Raspberry Pi and an ESP32 microcontroller are wirelessly connected to smart glasses as part of the system.  The glasses have sensors such as a camera for text and face recognition, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a heart rate sensor for health monitoring.
The main innovation is the text-to-Braille converter, which intakes the manual text by now but can add camera in future for better output, processes it on the Raspberry Pi using optical character recognition (OCR).  A tactile display that uses solenoids to simulate raised dots to create Braille characters shows the converted Braille output.  In order to detect objects and identify faces, the device also offers aural feedback via an integrated headphone.
The project incorporates a dashboard with a Braille chart and real-time location and health tracking to improve care support. Through the integration of cutting-edge assistive technology into a single, all-inclusive solution, this initiative seeks to increase the independence and safety of people with visual impairments.
